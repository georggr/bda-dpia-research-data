# Establishing a Comprehensive Privacy Impact Assessment Methodology for Big Data Analytics in Compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation

This repository contains the questionnaires and raw data collected from a three-round Delphi study, followed by expert interviews. The data provided here is critical to understanding the findings and recommendations outlined in our research paper, which focuses on enhancing the Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) framework in the context of Big Data Analytics (BDA). By accessing this data, researchers and practitioners can gain deeper insights into the key Privacy Touch Points (PTPs) identified and validated throughout the study, which aim to improve the alignment of DPIA practices with the unique challenges posed by BDA.

## Repository Structure

The data is organised into two main folders: **Delphi** and **Interview**.

### 1. Delphi Folder
The **Delphi** folder contains all data related to the Delphi study, which was conducted in three rounds. This includes:

- **Questionnaires**: Copies of the questionnaires used in each of the three rounds.
- **Raw Data**: The raw data collected from each round, providing insights into how the experts responded during the study.

You can find the following files in this folder:
- `questionnaire-round-1.pdf` – Delphi Round 1 Questionnaire
- `questionnaire-round-2.pdf` – Delphi Round 2 Questionnaire
- `questionnaire-round-3.pdf` – Delphi Round 3 Questionnaire
- `raw-data-round-1.xlsx` – Raw data from Delphi Round 1
- `raw-data-round-2.xlsx` – Raw data from Delphi Round 2
- `raw-data-round-3.xlsx` – Raw data from Delphi Round 3

### 2. Interview Folder
The **Interview** folder contains data from the expert interviews conducted after the Delphi study. It includes:

- **Interview Questions**: The list of questions used to guide the expert interviews.
- **Raw Data**: The raw data collected during the interviews.

Files in this folder include:
- `interview-questions.pdf` – Interview Questions
- `raw-data-interviews.xlsx` – Raw data from the expert interviews

## Purpose of the Repository

This repository serves as an open-access space for researchers, scholars, and practitioners interested in understanding the enhancement of DPIA processes in BDA environments. By making this data publicly available, we aim to encourage transparency, collaboration, and further research in this field.
